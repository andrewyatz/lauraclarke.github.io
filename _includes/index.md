As the 1000 Genomes Project data generation and analysis drawns to a close the International Sample Genome Resource (IGSR) has been established at [EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk). IGSR is continuing to support the data generated by the [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.1000genomes.org) in the longer term.

The IGSR has three main aims for the 1000 Genomes Dataset:

1. Ensure the future usability of the 1000 Genomes reference data;
2. Incorporate published genomic data on the 1000 Genomes samples;
3. Expand the data collection to include new populations.

Our aims are explained in more details on our [project page]({{ '/about' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Data will still be hosted on the [1000 Genomes FTP site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/). More information about the data available on our [data page]({{ '/data' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
