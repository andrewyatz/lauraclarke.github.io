#The International Sample Genome Resource (IGSR)

The International Sample Genome Resource (IGSR) was established at [EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk) in January 2015. IGSR is continuing to support the data generated by the [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.1000genomes.org) in the longer term.

The IGSR has three main aims:

1. Ensure the future usability of the 1000 Genomes reference data;
2. Incorporate published genomic data on the 1000 Genomes samples;
3. Expand the data collection to include new populations.


Our aims are explained in more details on our [Project page](igsr_project.md)
Our data will still be hosted on the [1000 Genomes FTP site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/). There is more information about the data available on our [Data page](igsr_data.md)
