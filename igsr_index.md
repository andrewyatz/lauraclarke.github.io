#The International Sample Genome Resource (IGSR)

The International Sample Genome Resource (IGSR) was established at [EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk) in January 2015. IGSR is continuing to support the data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project in the longer term.

The IGSR has three main aims:

 1. Ensure maximal usefulness and relevance of existing 1000 Genomes data resources
 2. Extension of resources on the same populations
 3. Expansion of the resource to new populations

Our aims are explained in more details on our [Project page](Need to write a project.md)
Our data will still be hosted on the [1000 Genomes FTP site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/). There is more information about the data available on our [Data page](Need to write a data.md)
